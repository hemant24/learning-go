Book I am following have source code at : https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Learning-Go-Programming


====Installation===============

tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.8.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz



Add /usr/local/go/bin to the PATH environment variable. You can do this by adding this line to your /etc/profile (for a system-wide installation) or $HOME/.profile:

export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin



I added above line (export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin) to /home/vagrant/.profile 

then do 

> source /home/vagrant/.profile 



> go
go version go1.8.3 linux/amd64

So successfully installed !!

I have added PATH and GOPATH to ~/.profile, ~/.bashrc and /etc/profile


> vi ~/.profile
>	Enter following to the end of the file 
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
